abstract: 'An increase in the urban population leads to a rise in air pollution, such as particulate matter, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, and noise pollution. All pollutants have some adverse health effects on the human body. Statistical evaluations can be used for prediction purposes, which may help to reduce pollution in the future. Real-time air pollution and noise data were collected using commercially available customized eight sensing devices installed in residential zones, near industrial zone and traffic interception zones in Delhi for the years 2018 and 2019. Real-time monitoring of air pollutants and noise levels give a large amount of data, which is very helpful for statistical operations. The Pearson correlation and Spearman correlation methods are used to calculate the correlation coefficient among air pollutants, meteorological parameters, and noise. '
