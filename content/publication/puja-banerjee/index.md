abstract: 'Recently, there is a rapid increase in the use of Internet of Things (IoT) technology, and it is envisaged that in the forthcoming days, billions of devices and things are going to be interconnected among themselves with the help of Internet. To make this technology self-sustainable, there is a need for an incessant energy supply that can be achieved through green energy harvesting. IoT has attracted the attention of researchers as well as practitioners all over the globe by serving as an important architecture for communication systems, but the terminal devices used in IoT are resource-constrained, which results in low energy storage capacity and low computing power. Among several tasks that need to be performed at the level of IoT node, the data transmission is the most energy intensive phase. To provide continuous power to nodes used in IoT systems, it is imperative that the available energy source should be used judiciously and in an optimized manner. In this paper, an energy efficient data transmission scheme for IoT devices has been proposed. The result obtained through extensive experiments depicts that there is a high potential for saving energy during the process of data transmission.'
