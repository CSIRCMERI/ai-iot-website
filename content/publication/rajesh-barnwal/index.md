abstract: 'Deep learning (DL) is a very powerful computational tool for various applications in scientific and industrial research which can be real-time implemented for societal benefits. Several factors impact the development of optimized DL models for better prediction including the amount of quality sample data, domain-specific knowledge, and the architecture of the model for extraction of the useful features/patterns from the data. The present chapter demonstrates the state-of-the-art DL methodologies used by the researchers from different laboratories under the Council of Scientific and Industrial Research (CSIR), India to solve important research activities across several sectors like Medical, Healthcare, Agriculture, Energy, etc. The Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) techniques are utilized for Tumor diagnosis, classifying molecular subtypes of glioma tissues, and predicting driver gene mutations in glioma.'
