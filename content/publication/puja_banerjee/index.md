abstract: 'Explainable Artificial Intelligence (AI) assists the human user to understand the decision-making process of the machine and thus builds trust and confidence in them during deployment. Though such an algorithmic explaination helps but the basic research question remains unanswered: "Whether the deep network model also generates the same attention maps as the visual attention being used by the human to perceive the task of image classification?". In this paper, the authors made an effort to find the answer to the said question with the help of an empirical study with a benchmark dataset.
Several studies [2, 3] have been made in the past which proved that attention is not correlated with algorithmic explainations in the case of NLP problems.'
