abstract: 'The increasing deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies in different societal infrastructures, like household water quality monitoring systems, necessitates the development of robust methods to synchronize vast datasets across multi-tiered cloud infrastructures. This paper introduces a comprehensive and highly scalable framework designed to facilitate the efficient synchronization of IoT-generated water quality and quantity data between heterogeneous cloud environments. The framework employs a hybrid data aggregation mechanism, optimizing both network bandwidth and computational resources while minimizing latency. Using a sender-receiver architecture, the proposed system ensures seamless data transfer by dynamically segmenting and processing large datasets in parallel, maintaining real-time data integrity and consistency across distributed systems. This approach addresses critical challenges inherent to large-scale IoT deployments, such as data duplication, transfer delays, and system overhead through concurrent data handling and fault-tolerant mechanisms. The framework is positioned to enhance scalability and reliability, making it well-suited for use in environments that require frequent, high-volume data synchronization, such as governmental water quality monitoring networks.'
