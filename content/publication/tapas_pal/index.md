abstract: 'This chapter offers explicit knowledge and common research problems on how computer science is taking part in different image-based disease diagnosis and their challenges. The chapter also discusses different methods of deep learning and the theories behind medical image analytics, their benefits over manual annotation, contemporary solutions related to classification, and segmentation of computed tomography images to identify emerging diseases of the lungs. This chapter will conclude by presenting gaps and future scopes for research in the domain. Using computer-based techniques increases doctorsâ€™ ability to diagnose diseases and conduct risk analysis more accurately. It gives some very helpful predictions even when the domain expert doctors are unavailable.'
