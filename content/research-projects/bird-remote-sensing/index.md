Research focuses on developing explainable AI (XAI) methods to enhance the adversarial robustness of machine learning models. The work contributed to the understanding and mitigation of adversarial attacks, which aim to deceive machine learning models by introducing carefully crafted perturbations to their inputs. The research has led to several ground breaking contributions in the field of XAI and adversarial robustness, including the development of novel XAI techniques that can provide meaningful explanations for the predictions of complex machine learning models, and the proposal of innovative methods to improve the robustness of machine learning models against adversarial attacks.
